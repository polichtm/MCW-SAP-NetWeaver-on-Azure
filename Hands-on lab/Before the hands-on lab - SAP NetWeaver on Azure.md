# SAP NetWeaver on Azure before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

-   A Microsoft Azure subscription with at least 40 vCPU available in the Azure region where the Azure VMs deployed in this lab will reside.

    -   AD VMs -- 2 x D4s\_v3: 2 x 4 vCPUs = 8 vCPUs

    -   ASCS VMs -- 2 x D4s\_v3: 2 x 4 vCPUs = 8 vCPUs

    -   DB VMs -- 2 x D8s\_v3: 2 x 8 vCPUs = 16 vCPUs

    -   APP VMs -- 2 x D4s\_v3: 2 x 4 vCPUs = 8 vCPUs

   > **Note**: The Azure region you select must support Active Directory authentication for Azure File shares. For the listing of regions supporting this functionality, refer to <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable>.

   > **Note**: The lab VM does not require locally installed software. Az PowerShell tasks are run in Cloud Shell in the Azure portal and directly from Azure VMs deployed throughout the course of the lab. If you decide to run some of these tasks from the lab computer, install Az PowerShell (module version 2.1.0 or newer).

-   Access to SAP binaries described in task 5 of this document

-   Internet access from the lab VM

## Before the hands-on lab

Timeframe: 30 minutes

Review the relevant Microsoft documentation.

### Task 1: Review the relevant Microsoft documentation 

1.  Review to the documentation regarding highly available architecture and scenarios of SAP NetWeaver on Azure at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-architecture-scenarios>.

1.  Review to the documentation regarding Az PowerShell at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-3.6.1>.

### Task 2: Validate the owner role assignment in the Azure subscription

1.  Login to the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Subscriptions** and, in the list of results, select **Subscriptions**.

1.  On the **Subscriptions** blade, select the name of the subscription you intend to use for this lab.

1.  On the subscription blade, select **Access control (IAM)**.

1.  Switch to the **Role assignments** tab, review the list of role assignments, and verify that your user account has the Owner role assigned to it.

### Task 3: Validate the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription

1.  In the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Azure Active Directory** and, in the list of results, select  **Azure Active Directory**.

1.  On the Azure Active Directory blade, select **Users**.

1.  On the **Users | All Users** blade, select the entry representing your user account. 

1.  On the blade displaying properties of your user account, select **Assigned roles**.

1.  Verify that the list of the directory roles assigned to your user account includes the **Global administrator** entry. 

### Task 4: Validate sufficient number of vCPU cores

1.  In the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>.

1.  In the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist content of your Cloud Shell home directory. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1.  In the Azure portal, in the **Cloud Shell**, at the PowerShell prompt, run the following: where `<Azure_region>` designates the target Azure region that you intend to use for this lab (e.g. `eastus`):

    ```powershell
    Get-AzVMUsage -Location <Azure_region> | Where-Object {$_.Name.Value -eq 'StandardDSv3Family'}
    ``` 

    > **Note**: To identify the names of Azure regions, in the **Cloud Shell**, at the PowerShell prompt, run `(Get-AzLocation).Location`.
   
1.  Review the output of the command executed in the previous step and ensure that you have at least 40 available vCPUs in the **Standard DSv3 Family** in the target Azure region.

1.  If the number of vCPUs is not sufficient, in the Azure portal, navigate back to the subscription blade, and select **Usage + quotas**. 

1.  On the subscription's **Usage + quotas** blade, select **Request Increase**.

1.  On the **Basic** blade, specify the following and select **Next: Solutions >**:

    -   Issue type: **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**

    -   Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.

    -   Quota type: **Compute-VM (cores-vCPUs) subscription limit increases**

    -   Support plan: the name of the support plan associated with the target subscription.

1.  On the **Details** blade, select the **Provide details** link.

1.  On the **Quota details** blade, specify the following and select **Save and continue**:

    -   Deployment model: **Resource Manager**

    -   Location: the target Azure region you intend to use in this lab.

    -   Types: **Standard**

    -   Standard: **DSv3 Series** 
    
    -   New vCPU Limit: the new limit

1.  Back on the **Details** blade, specify the following and select **Next: Review + create >**:

    -   Severity: **C - Minimal impact**

    -   Preferred contact method: choose your preferred option and provide your contact details
    
1.  On the **Review + create** blade, select **Create**.

   > **Note**: It might take a few days for quota increase requests to be completed.

### Task 5: Identify SAP binaries

1.  From the lab computer, start a Web browser, navigate to **SAP Software Downloads** at https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter/ and log on using your SAP Online Service System account.
