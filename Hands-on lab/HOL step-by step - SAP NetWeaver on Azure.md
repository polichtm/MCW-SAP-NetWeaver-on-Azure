# SAP on Azure hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab you will setup and configure SAP NetWeaver on Azure infrastructure as a service component. You will setup identity management, Scale-Out File Server (SOFS), NetWeaver application and database tiers and configure them all in a domain. You will then setup high-availability by configuring failover clustering for the SAP ASCS servers. Finally, you will configure the database tier with Always-On Availability Groups and configure the NetWeaver application servers for redundancy and enhanced monitoring.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will be better able to deploy SAP on Azure infrastructure components, configure SAP NetWeaver ASCS servers, configure SAP NetWeaver database servers, and configure SAP NetWeaver Application servers.

## Overview

Contoso has asked you to develop a process of provisioning a highly available, Windows Server 2016-based SAP NetWeaver deployment on Azure, with SAP Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) stack and SQL Server 2016 as the database tier. To provide high-availability of the ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS) components, you will implement an instance of a failover cluster. The ASCS component will leverage a Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) cluster, providing support for highly-available shared storage hosting the sapmnt share. To provide high-availability of the database tier, you will implement an instance of SQL Server Always-On Availability Group. In both cases, you will use a Cloud Witness quorum, introduced in Windows Server 2016 Failover Clustering. All Azure VMs will be using managed disks. To streamline deployment, you will take advantage of Azure Resource Manager templates and Windows PowerShell scripts.

## Solution architecture

From the architectural standpoint, the deployment will consist of the following layers:

-   Authentication layer -- two Active Directory domain controllers

-   Shared storage -- two servers configured as a Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) cluster

    -   Failover Clustering will rely on Cloud Witness-based quorum

    -   The cluster will host a Scale Out File Server (SOFS) containing the highly available sapmnt share

-   SAP ASCS layer -- two servers configured as members of a two-node Windows Failover Clustering cluster

    -   Failover Clustering will rely on Cloud Witness-based quorum

    -   An Azure internal load balancer will provide a front-end IP address of the ASCS Failover Clustering role

-   SAP Application instances layer -- two SAP application servers:

    -   Primary Application Server (PAS)

    -   Additional Application Server (AAS)

-   SAP Database layer -- two servers hosting separate instances of SQL Server 2016 configured as nodes of a SQL Server Always-On Availability Group cluster

    -   Failover Clustering will rely on Cloud Witness-based quorum

    -   An Azure internal load balancer will provide a front-end IP address of the Always-On Availability Group listener

To facilitate high-availability on the platform level, each pair of Azure virtual machines (VMs) in each layer will belong to the same managed availability set.

## Exercise 1: Deploy the SAP on Azure infrastructure components 

Duration: 130 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy Azure infrastructure prerequisites for implementing SAP NetWeaver on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). This will include creating such resources as an Azure Virtual Network, Azure VMs and Azure load balancers. You will also use this infrastructure to deploy Active Directory domain controllers to Azure VMs, and subsequently, join all remaining Azure VMs to the same Active Directory domain.

### Task 1: Deploy Active Directory domain controller VMs

In this task, you will deploy two Azure VMs hosting Active Directory domain controllers of the domain contoso.com by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template from GitHub available at <https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/active-directory-new-domain-ha-2-dc>. You will use the following settings during deployment:

-   Resource group name: **s03-RG**

-   Admin Username: **demouser**

-   Admin Password: **demo\@pass123**

-   Domain Name: **contoso.com**

1.  From the lab computer, start a Web browser, and navigate to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>

2.  When prompted, sign in to the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab

3.  From the lab computer, start another instance of the Web browser, and navigate to <https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/active-directory-new-domain-ha-2-dc>

4.  On the **Create 2 new Windows VMs, create a new AD Forest, Domain and 2 DCs in an availability set** page, and select **Deploy to Azure**

5.  The Web browser window should automatically be redirected to the Azure portal, and display the **Create a new AD Domain with 2 Domain Controllers** blade.

6.  On the **Create a new AD Domain with 2 Domain Controllers** blade, specify the following settings:

    -   Subscription: *your Azure subscription name*

    -   Resource group: **s03-RG**

    -   Location: *Azure region close to your physical location*

    -   Admin Username: **demouser**

    -   Admin Password: **demo\@pass123**

    -   Domain Name: **contoso.com**

    -   Dns Prefix: *a unique DNS name*

    -   Pdc RDP Port: **3389**

    -   Bdc RDP Port: **13389**

    -   \_artifacts Location: *accept the default entry*

    -   \_artifacts Location Sas Token: *Leave blank*

7.  Enable the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**, and select **Purchase**

8.  Wait for the deployment to complete. This might take about 30 minutes.

### Task 2: Prepare the Azure Virtual Network and Active Directory hosted on Azure VMs for deployment of SAP NetWeaver application and database tier VMs 

In this task, you will configure Azure Virtual Network and Active Directory hosted on Azure VMs to prepare for deployment of additional Azure VMs that will be hosting your SAP implementation. On the Azure management layer, this will include adding an extra subnet named **sapSubnet** with the IP address range **10.0.1.0/24**, and assigning the DNS server representing the newly deployed domain controllers to the adVNET Virtual Network. From the DNS name resolution and Active Directory standpoint, you will perform the following steps:

-   In the contoso.com DNS zone:

    -   Enable non-secure updates

    -   Create the following DNS Host (A) records:

        -   **s03-ascs-v0 10.0.1.6** (this IP address must match the IP address that will be assigned to the front end of the ASCS-layer internal load balancer)

        -   **s03-ascs-ers0 10.0.1.8** (this IP address must match the IP address that will be assigned to the first Azure VM of the ASCS-layer)

        -   **s03-ascs-ers1 10.0.1.9** (this IP address must match the IP address that will be assigned to the second Azure VM of the ASCS-layer)

        -   **s03-di-v0 10.0.1.28** (this IP address must match the IP address that will be assigned to the SAP Primary Application Server s0-di-0)

        -   **s03-di-v1 10.0.1.29** (this IP address must match the IP address that will be assigned to the SAP Additional Application Server s0-di-1)

-   In the contoso.com Active Directory:

    -   Create an organizational unit in the root of the contoso.com domain named **S03** that will host SAP-specific users and groups

    -   Create the following user accounts with non-expiring password set to **demo\@pass123** that will be used to facilitate the SAP implementation:

        -   **s03-su**: member of contoso\\Domain Admins and contoso\\Administrators. You will use this account to perform all operating system level configuration tasks, including installation of all SAP components

        -   **s03-db-0-sqlsvc**: you will use this account to configure SQL Server 2016 services on the first SQL Server VM

        -   **s03-db-1-sqlsvc**: you will use this account to configure SQL Server 2016 services on the second SQL Server VM

### Task 5: Configure IP addresses of Azure VMs and internal load balancers

In this exercise, you will configure Public and Private IP addressing for the Azure VMs and internal load balancers deployed in the previous task by using an Azure Resource Manager template. You will assign to each VM a designated, static Private IP address and a dynamic Public IP address. You will also assign a designated, static Private IP address to each load balancer.

**Note:** At this point, each of the Azure VMs we have deployed in the previous task has a dynamically assigned Private IP address and no Public IP address. The lack of Public IP addresses is the result of using the SAP NW 3-tier compatible Marketplace image template which is intended to work this way when deploying it into an existing Azure Virtual Network. When operating in a production environment, you should connect to VMs via their Private IP address (e.g. by leveraging an existing Site-to-Site VPN or ExpressRoute from an on-premises location). You will add a Public IP to each VM in order to simplify the setup process. We will also assign a designated static Private IP address to each VM and each internal load balancer in order to be able to reference specific IP addresses throughout this lab.

Configure the Private IP addresses of VMs and load balancers in the following manner:

-   s03-nic-ascs-0: 10.0.1.8

-   s03-nic-ascs-1: 10.0.1.9

-   s03-nic-db-0: 10.0.1.18

-   s03-nic-db-1: 10.0.1.19

-   s03-nic-di-0: 10.0.1.28

-   s03-nic-di-1: 10.0.1.29

-   s03-lb-db: 10.0.1.16

-   s03-lb-ascs: 10.0.1.6

1.  From the lab computer, start a Windows PowerShell ISE window as Administrator

2.  In the Script pane, type the following script, and press F5 to execute it. When prompted to sign in after typing the first command, type in the credentials you used to authenticate your Azure subscription.

```

3.  After the script completes, restart all servers

### Summary

In this exercise, you deployed Azure infrastructure prerequisites for implementing SAP NetWeaver on Azure IaaS virtual machines (VMs). This included creation of such resources as an Azure Virtual Network, Azure VMs, Azure load balancers and Azure Storage accounts. You also used this infrastructure to deploy Active Directory domain controllers to Azure VMs and subsequently joined all remaining Azure VMs to the same Active Directory domain.

## Exercise 2: Configure the SAP NetWeaver ASCS servers

Duration: 90 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will configure the Azure VMs that constitute the SAP ASCS layer. This will include installing Failover Clustering on s03-ascs-0 and s03-ascs-1. You will also run the SAP Software Provisioning Manager to perform distributed installation of the ASCS components on the s03-ascs-0 and s03-ascs-1 VMs. Afterwards, you will configure the SOFS-based sapmnt share and create SAP NetWeaver ASCS cluster resources by following instructions described in <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-installation-wsfc-file-share> .

### Task 1: Set up Failover Clustering on the ASCS VMs

In this task, you will start by configuring operating system on s03-ascs-0 and s03-ascs-1. On both VMs, mount the 128 GB data disk as ReFS-formatted U: drive with the disk label **SAP Local FS**. On both VMs, disable Windows firewall for the domain profile. Next, implement a Failover Clustering-based cluster named **s03-ascs-cl0** with the IP address of **10.0.1.7** consisting of **s03-ascs-0** and **s03-ascs-1** Azure VMs. Set up the cluster with a Cloud Witness quorum by using the storage account that was auto-provisioned in the previous exercise when you deployed Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) cluster.

1.  Navigate to the **s03-ascs-0** VM blade in the Azure portal, and use the **Connect** icon in the toolbar to establish an RDP session to that VM. When prompted to authenticate, sign in with the **CONTOSO\\s03-su** user account you created in the first exercise.

2.  Within the RDP session to s03-ascs-0 VM, start a Windows PowerShell ISE session as Administrator, and run the following:

```
    $nodes = ('s03-ascs-0','s03-ascs-1')

    Invoke-Command $nodes {Get-Disk -Number 2 | Initialize-Disk -PartitionStyle MBR -PassThru | New-Partition -DriveLetter 'U' -UseMaximumSize | Format-Volume -FileSystem ReFS -NewFileSystemLabel 'SAP Local FS' -Confirm:$false}

    Invoke-Command $nodes {Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain -Enabled False}

    Invoke-Command $nodes {Install-WindowsFeature Failover-Clustering -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools} 
```

3.  From the Windows PowerShell ISE session, run:

```
    New-Cluster -Name s03-ascs-cl0 -Node $nodes ???NoStorage ???StaticAddress 10.0.1.7
```

4.  Wait for the new cluster to be created. Then from the same Windows PowerShell ISE session, run:

```
    Install-PackageProvider ???Name NuGet ???Force

    Install-Module ???Name AzureRM -Force

    Add-AzureRmAccount

    $cwStorageAccountName = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName s2d-RG)[0].StorageAccountName

    $cwStorageAccountKey = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName s2d-RG -Name $cwStorageAccountName).Value[0]

    Set-ClusterQuorum ???CloudWitness ???AccountName $cwStorageAccountName -AccessKey $cwStorageAccountKey
```

    When prompted, sign in with the Service Administrator account of your Azure subscription (if the sign-in fails, rerun the script). Wait for the configuration of the Cloud Witness quorum completes.

### Task 2: Install the SAP ASCS components on s03-ascs-0

In this task, you will use SAP Software Provisioning Manager to carry out the distributed installation of ASCS components on the second node of ASCS cluster of MS SQL Server-based SAP NetWeaver 7.5 deployment. Run the installation as the **CONTOSO\\s03-su** account you created in the first exercise. During the installation, address all necessary prerequisites, and specify the following parameters:

-   Drive for Local Instances: **U:**

-   SAP System ID (SAPSID): **S03**

-   DNS Domain Name for SAP Systems: **contoso.com**

-   SAP System User Domain: **Domain of Current User**

-   OU Path: **S03**

-   Windows Domain for SAP Host Agent: **Local Domain**

-   ABAP Message Server Ports: **3600**

-   Internal ABAP Message Server Ports: **3900**

-   Install SAP Web Dispatcher integrated: **Yes**

-   Set SAP Web Dispatcher Encryption Mode: **Never**

-   Set all passwords to **demo\@pass123**

Account for the fact you will be using the virtual names, and configure the following registry entries on both VMs:

-   HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA

    -   Set DisableLoopbackCheck to 1

-   HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\lanmanserver\\parameters

    -   Set DisableStrictNameChecking to 1

### Summary

In this exercise, you will configure the Azure VMs that constitute the SAP ASCS layer. This included installing and configuring Failover Clustering on both VMs. You also used the procedure described at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-installation-wsfc-file-share> to configure the ASCS cluster with the sapmnt share hosted on the SOFS you installed in the previous exercise.

## Exercise 3: Configure SAP NetWeaver database servers

Duration: 120 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will configure the SAP NetWeaver database servers. You will start by installing a separate, stand-alone instance of SQL Server 2016 on each VM. Next, you will run SAP Software Provisioning Manager to install HA DB component on the s03-db-0 VM. Afterwards, you will implement high-availability by setting both SQL Server instances as members of the same Always-On Availability Group. Just as in the previous exercise, you will use Cloud Witness to provide the quorum for the Failover Cluster. You will also copy SQL Server logins from the instance hosted on s03-db-0 to the instance hosted on s03-db-1. Finally, you will update the SAP default profile to point to the Always-On Availability Group listener, rather than to an individual SQL Server 2016 instance.

### Task 1: Configure storage of the SAP database layer.

In this task, you will configure the Azure VMs for the database layer by attaching an extra Premium 512 GB data disk to each of them (the template-based deployment resulted in one disk of 128 GB in size already attached to every Azure VM within that deployment). Set the host caching on the 128 GB disk to **None** (since this disk will be used to host logs) and on the 512 GB disk to **Read**-**only** (since this disk will be used to host data files). To configure a Cloud Witness for the database cluster, you will use the same storage account you created in the second exercise when deploying the SAP Azure infrastructure components, so there is no need to create another storage account for this purpose.

1.  From the Azure portal, navigate to the **s03-db-0** VM blade, and select **Disks**

2.  From the **s03-db-0 - Disks** blade, add a 512 GB Premium managed data disk

3.  Set **Host caching** to **Read-only**

4.  Repeat steps from 1-3 for **s03-db-1**

### Task 2: Grant elevated user rights to the SQL Server service account

In this task, you will use Group Policy to grant the following user rights to the SQL Server service account (**s03-db-0-sqlsvc** and **s03-db-1-sqlsvc**) on the Window Server 2016 computers hosting their respective SQL Server instances.

-   Perform volume maintenance tasks

-   Lock pages in memory

These options provide potential performance improvements, as documented in <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-instant-file-initialization?view=sql-server-2016> and <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows?view=sql-server-2016> .

In a production deployment, you should consider using domain-based Group Policy Objects rather than local Group Policy. This approach is used in this lab strictly for simplicity.

1.  Navigate to the **s03-db-0** VM blade in the Azure portal, and use the **Connect** icon in the toolbar to establish an RDP session to that VM. When prompted to authenticate, sign in with the **CONTOSO\\s03-su** user account you created in the first exercise.

2.  Within the RDP session to s03-db-0 VM, start Group Policy Editor from the Tools menu in Server Manager

3.  In the left pane of the Group Policy Editor console, expand **Local Computer Policy -\> Computer Configuration -\> Windows Settings -\> Security Settings -\> Local Policies**, and then select **User Rights Assignment**

4.  In the right pane, double-click **Perform volume maintenance tasks**

5.  In the **Perform volume maintenance tasks Properties** window, select **Add User or Group**

6.  In the **Select Users or Groups** dialog box, type **CONTOSO\\s03-db-0-sqlsvc** and select **OK** twice

7.  Back in the Group Policy Editor console, in the right pane, double-click **Lock pages in memory**

8.  In the **Lock pages in memory Properties** window, select **Add User or Group**

9.  In the **Select Users or Groups** dialog box, type **CONTOSO\\s03-db-0-sqlsvc** and select **OK** twice

10. Restart **s03-db-0**

11. Repeat steps 1-10 on s03-db-1, but this time assign both user rights to **CONTOSO\\s03-db-1-sqlsvc**

### Task 3: Install SQL Server 2016 with the SQL\_Latin1\_General\_CP850\_BIN2 collation

In this task, you will configure operating system on s03-db-0 and s03-db-1, and install SQL Server 2016 with the latest Service Pack and Cumulative Update on s03-db-0 and s03-db-1 Azure VMs. Run the installation as the **CONTOSO\\s03-su** account you created in the first exercise. Start by disabling the Windows firewall for the domain profile and mounting the 128 GB data disk as ReFS-formatted L: drive with the disk label **Logs Disk** and the 512 GB data disk as ReFS-formatted M: drive with the disk label **Data Disk**. Perform the installation of SQL Server 2016 on both s03-db-0 and s03-db-1 with the following settings:

-   Use Microsoft Update to check for updates (recommended): **disabled**

-   Feature Selection:

    -   **Database Engine Services**

    -   **Client Tools Connectivity **

-   Instance Configuration: **Default instance**

-   Service Accounts:

    -   s03-db-0

        -   SQL Server: **contoso\\s03-db-0-sqlsvc**

        -   SQL Server Agent: **contoso\\s03-db-0-sqlsvc**

    -   s03-db-1

        -   SQL Server: **contoso\\s03-db-1-sqlsvc**

        -   SQL Server Agent: **contoso\\s03-db-1-sqlsvc**

-   Collation: **SQL\_Latin1\_General\_CP850\_BIN2**

-   Windows authentication mode:

    -   SQL Server Administrators

        -   **contoso\\s03-su**

        -   **s03-db-0\\Administrators**

-   Data Directories:

    -   **Data root directory: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server**

    -   **User database directory: M:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\\Data**

    -   **User database log directory: L:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\\Data**

    -   **Backup directory: M:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\\Backup**

-   TempDB:

    -   **Data directories: M:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\\Data (note that you'll need to create this directory)**

    -   **Log directory: L:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\\Data\**

    -   **On both s03-db-0 and s03-db-1, download and install SQL Server Management Studio with the default settings**

    -   **Copy SAP specific logins from s03-db-0 to s03-db-1 with their existing settings, including the default database and the server role**

12. Navigate to the **s03-db-0** VM blade in the Azure portal, and use the **Connect** icon in the toolbar to establish an RDP session to that VM. When prompted to authenticate, sign in with the **CONTOSO\\s03-su** user account you created in the first exercise.

13. Within the RDP session to s03-db-0 VM, start a Windows PowerShell ISE session as Administrator, and run the following:

```

### Task 5: Implement Always-On Availability Group

In this task, you will implement a Failover Clustering-based cluster named **s03-db-cl0** with the IP address of **10.0.1.17** on s03-db0 and s03-db-1 Azure VMs with Always-On Availability Group hosting the SAP database. Set up the cluster with a Cloud Witness quorum by using the storage account you created in the second exercise. To prepare for setting up Always-On Availability Group for the SAP database you installed in the previous task, grant the **Create Computer Objects** permissions on the **Computers** container in the contoso.com Active Directory to the newly created **contoso\\s03-db-cl0** account. In addition, create a directory structure on s03-db-1 that matches the directory structure on the M: and L: drives of s03-db-0.

Next, from SQL Server Configuration Manager, enable Always-On Availability Groups, and restart the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service on both s03-db-0 and s03-db-01. On s03-db-0, create a new share **C:\\Backup** named **Backup**. On the share level and on the ReFS level, grant **Read/Write** permissions to **CONTOSO\\s03-db-0-sqlsvc** account and **Read** permissions to the **CONTOSO\\s03-db-1-sqlsvc** account.

From SQL Server Management Studio on s03-db-0, use the New Availability Group Wizard to create a new Availability Group with the following settings:

-   Name: **s03-db-ag0**

-   User database for availability group: **S03**

-   Replicas: **S03-DB-0 and S03-DB-1**

    -   Automatic Failover: **Yes**

    -   Synchronous Commit: **Yes**

    -   Readable Secondary: **No**

    -   Initial Data Synchronization: **Full**

    -   A shared network location accessible by all replicas: [**\\\\S03-DB-0\\Backup**](file://S03-DB-0/Backup)

**Note:** The majority of customers choose to use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) when deploying SQL Server databases to Azure. If you use TDE, then you cannot use the Always-On Availability Group wizard. Instead, you have to follow the instructions described in <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/saponsqlserver/2017/04/04/more-questions-from-customers-about-sql-server-transparent-data-encryption-tde-azure-key-vault/> . Alternatively, you can enable TDE after establishing the Always On Availability Group, however this is a tedious and slow process. For the purpose of this lab, you will not enable TDE and use the Always-On Availability Group wizard when setting up the Always-On Availability Group.

In the Failover Cluster Manager, create a new Client Access Point with the following settings:

-   Name: **s03-db-agl0**

-   IP address: **10.0.1.16 (static) --** *make sure it matches the IP address assigned to the s03-lb-db load balancer*

Set the dependency of **s03-db-ag0** on **s03-db-agl0**.

Use Windows PowerShell to set the properties of the IP address resource of the newly created Client Access Point as follows:

-   Address: **10.0.1.16**

-   ProbePort: **59999**

-   SubnetMask: **255.255.255.255**

-   Network: **Cluster Network 1**

-   EnableDhcp: **0**

In the SQL Server Management Studio, set the port of the **s03-db-agl0** listener to **1433**.

Bring the Always-On Availability Group clustered role online.

1.  Within the RDP session to s03-db-0 VM, start a Windows PowerShell ISE session as Administrator, and run the following:

```
    $nodes = ('s03-db-0','s03-db-1')

    Invoke-Command $nodes {Install-WindowsFeature Failover-Clustering -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools} 
```

2.  From the Windows PowerShell ISE session, run:

```
    New-Cluster -Name s03-db-cl0 -Node $nodes ???NoStorage ???StaticAddress 10.0.1.17
```

3.  Wait for the new cluster to be created. Then from the same Windows PowerShell ISE session, run:

```
    Install-PackageProvider ???Name NuGet ???Force

    Install-Module ???Name AzureRM -Force

    Add-AzureRmAccount

    $cwStorageAccountName = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName s2d-RG)[0].StorageAccountName

    $cwStorageAccountKey = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName s2d-RG -Name $cwStorageAccountName).Value[0]

    Set-ClusterQuorum ???CloudWitness ???AccountName $cwStorageAccountName -AccessKey $cwStorageAccountKey
```

    When prompted, sign in with the Service Administrator account of your Azure subscription (if the sign-in fails, rerun the script). Wait for the configuration of the Cloud Witness quorum completes

4.  From the Remote Desktop session to adPDC, start Active Directory Administrative Center

5.  In the Active Directory Administrative Center, navigate to the Computers container of the contoso.com domain, and display its properties

### Task 6: Modify the SAP Default Profile

In this task, you will modify the SAP default profile in order to ensure the application tier communicates with the database tier via the newly created Always-On Availability Group listener. To accomplish this, set the value of the **dbs/mss/server** parameter to the name of the newly created Availability Group listener (**s03-db-agl0**) in the default profile of the S03 SAP system (hosted on the shared disk of the ASCS layer). In order for the change to take effect, restart the VMs that constitute the SAP ASCS layer.

1.  Within the RDP session to s03-ascs-0 VM, open the file **S:\\usr\\sap\\S03\\SYS\\profile\\DEFAULT.PFL** in Notepad

2.  Change the entry **dbs/mss/server** from:

```
    dbs/mss/server = S03-DB-0
```

to:

```
    dbs/mss/server = S03-DB-AGL0
```

3.  Save the file

### Summary

In this exercise, you have configured the SAP NetWeaver database servers. You started by first installing a separate, stand-alone instance of SQL Server 2016 on each VM. Next, you ran SAP Software Provisioning Manager to install HA DB component on the s03-db-0 VM. Afterwards, you implemented high-availability by setting both SQL Server instances as members of the same Always-On Availability Group. Just as in the previous exercise, you used Cloud Witness to provide the quorum for the Failover Cluster. You also copied SQL Server logins from the instance hosted on s03-db-0 to the instance hosted on s03-db-1. Finally, you updated the SAP default profile to point to the Always-On Availability Group listener, rather than to an individual SQL Server 2016 instance.

## Exercise 4: Configure SAP NetWeaver Application servers

Duration: 50 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will configure the SAP NetWeaver application servers. You will start by installing Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on s03-di-0 and s03-di-1 Azure VMs. Next, you will use SAP Software Provisioning Manager to install the Primary Application Server (PAS) instance on s03-di-0 and follow with the installation of an Additional Application Server (AAS) instance on s03-di-1. In addition, you will install SAP Enhanced Monitoring Extension for SAP on Azure VMs included in your SAP deployment. Optionally, you might want to also consider disabling Internet Explorer by following these instructions: <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4013567/how-to-disable-internet-explorer-on-windows>.

### Task 1: Configure storage and software prerequisites of the SAP Application layer

In this task, you will configure the Azure VMs in the Application layer by mounting the 128 GB data disk as ReFS-formatted U: drive with the disk label **SAP Local FS**. On both VMs, disable Windows firewall for the domain profile. You will also install on both Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server (available from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=53339> ) to facilitate connectivity to the database tier.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the **s03-di-0** VM blade, and use the **Connect** icon in the toolbar to establish an RDP session to that VM. When prompted to authenticate, sign in with the **CONTOSO\\s03-su** user account you created in the first exercise.

2.  Within the RDP session to s03-di-0 VM, start a Windows PowerShell ISE session as Administrator, and run the following:

```
    $nodes = @('s03-di-0','s03-di-1')

    Invoke-Command $nodes {

    Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain -Enabled False

    Get-Disk -Number 2 | Initialize-Disk -PartitionStyle MBR -PassThru | New-Partition -DriveLetter 'U' -UseMaximumSize | Format-Volume -FileSystem ReFS -NewFileSystemLabel 'SAP Local FS' -Confirm:$false
    }
```

3.  Within the RDP session to s03-id-0 VM, start installation of Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server (available from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=53339>)

    ![The Welcome to the Installation Wizard page displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-SAPonAzureimages/media/image163.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Completing the ODBC Driver page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-SAPonAzureimages/media/image167.png)

8.  Repeat steps from 5-9 on **s03-di-1**

### Task 2: Install the SAP Primary Application Server (PAS) layer

In this task, you will install the SAP PAS of HA deployment of MS SQL Server-based SAP NetWeaver 7.5 HA deployment on s03-di-0 Azure VM by using the SAP Software Provisioning Manager. Run the installation as the **CONTOSO\\s03-su** account you created in the first exercise. During the installation, address all necessary prerequisites, and specify the following parameters:

-   Drive for Local Instances: **U:**

-   Windows Domain: **Domain of current user**

-   Database instance: **S03-DB-AGL0**

-   Existing MS SQL Server Database: **S03**

-   Windows Domain for SAP Host Agent: **Local Domain**

-   PAS Instance Host Name: **s03-di-v0**

-   ABAP Message Server Ports: **3600**

-   Internal ABAP Message Server Ports: **3900**

-   SLD Destination for the SAP System OS Level: **No SLD destination**

-   Message Server Access Control List: **Do not create Message Server Access Control List**

-   Secure Storage Key Generation: **Default Key**

-   Set all passwords to **demo\@pass123**

Account for the fact you are using the virtual names and configure the following registry entries on both VMs:

-   HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA

    -   Set DisableLoopbackCheck to 1

-   HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\lanmanserver\\parameters

    -   Set DisableStrictNameChecking to 1

1.  From a Remote Desktop session to s03-di-0, start SAP Software Provisioning Manager by double-clicking **sapinst.exe** in the **swpm** folder in the source media

        $computerSystem.AutomaticManagedPagefile = $false
        $computerSystem.Put()
        $pageFile = Get-WmiObject -Query "SELECT * FROM Win32_PageFileSetting WHERE Name LIKE '%pagefile.sys'"
        $pageFile.Delete()
        Set-WmiInstance -Class Win32_PageFileSetting -Arguments @{name="D:\pagefile.sys";InitialSize = 20480;MaximumSize = 20480;}
    }
```

14. From the Windows PowerShell ISE session, run:

```
    Invoke-Command $nodes {

        $registryValue = 1
        New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryEntry -Value $registryValue -PropertyType DWORD -Force
    }

    Invoke-Command $nodes {
        $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA'
        $registryEntry = 'DisableLoopbackCheck'
        $registryValue = 1
        New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryEntry -Value $registryValue -PropertyType DWORD -Force
    }

    Invoke-Command $nodes {
        $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters'

### Task 4: Install the SAP Enhanced Monitoring Extension for SAP

In this task, you will install SAP Enhanced Monitoring Extension for SAP on Azure VMs included in your SAP deployment.

1.  From the lab computer, start a Windows PowerShell ISE window as Administrator

2.  In the Script pane, type the following script, and press F5 to execute it. When prompted to sign in after typing the first command, type in the credentials you used to authenticate to your Azure subscription.

```
    Add-AzureRmAccount

    $rgName = 's03-RG'

    $rg = Get-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $rgName

    $saType = 'Standard_LRS'

    $saPrefix = 'saplab'

    $uniqueNumber = (Get-Date).Ticks.ToString().Substring(8)

    $saName = $saPrefix + $uniqueNumber 

    If ((Get-AzureRmStorageAccountNameAvailability -Name $saName).NameAvailable -ne $true) { 
        Do { 
           $uniqueNumber = (Get-Date).Ticks.ToString().Substring(8)
           $saName = $saPrefix + $uniqueNumber
        } Until ((Get-AzureRmStorageAccountNameAvailability -Name $saName).NameAvailable -eq $True)
    } 

    New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $saName -Type $saType -Location $rg.Location

    $vmNames = @('s03-di-0','s03-di-1','s03-db-0','s03-db-1','s03-ascs-0','s03-ascs-1')

    foreach ($vmName in $vmNames) {
        Set-AzureRmVMAEMExtension -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vmName -EnableWAD -WADStorageAccountName $saName
    }
```

### Summary

In this exercise, you configured the SAP NetWeaver application servers. You started by installing Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on the s03-di-0 and s03-di-1 Azure VMs. Next, you used SAP Software Provisioning Manager to install the Primary Application Server (PAS) instance on s03-di-0 and followed with the installation of an Additional Application Server (AAS) instance on s03-di-1.

## Lab summary

In this lab, you stepped through a process of provisioning a highly available, Windows Server 2016-based SAP NetWeaver deployment on Azure, with SAP ABAP stack and SQL Server 2016 as the database tier. To provide high-availability of the ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS) components, you implemented an instance of a Failover Cluster that leveraged a Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) cluster, hosting highly-available shared storage hosting the sapmnt share. To provide high-availability of the database tier, you implemented an instance of SQL Server Always-On Availability Group. In both cases, you will use a Cloud Witness quorum introduced in Windows Server 2016 Failover Clustering. To provide resiliency of the SAP application server instances, you deployed the Primary Application Server (PAS) and an Additional Application Server (AAS) in the same availability set.


## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 Minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1.  Now that the HOL is complete, go ahead and delete all of the Resource Groups created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources, and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.

- A GPO for "Perform Volume Maint. Tasks" for SQL service account

- A GPO for "Lock pages in memory" for SQL service account

- step to remove browser

- step to set the ACL on the SoFS sapmnt share (it might be "Everyone" full control)
